\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{What was your relevant prior knowledge and experience on security, Linux and networking or what did you do to obtain this knowledge?}
\hfill\break
\hfill\break
I'm from infrastructure and I used Ubuntu since 10.10 until I switched to macOS. So I had a basic understanding of Linux from the beginning. But the rest of the advanced knowledge in order to do the assignment was from workshops and taking notes or working together with classmates who were actively doing Hackthebox Academy.

\item \textbf{What was your preferred learning style. Why?}
\hfill\break
\hfill\break
Depends on the subject. If it is only a theory-based subject then I like to work alone or in private since it is mostly type work. But working with vCenter or doing an actual project I like to work hybrid of working within our group and alone and then discuss our results and helping each other.

\item \textbf{What motivated you to join cyber security?}
\hfill\break
\hfill\break
It sounds horrible but mostly for money. That's what I thought in the beginning now I like the blue teaming aspect, especially at the operating system level since my PSP is all about spoofing the operating system to hardware which is not compatible and still tries to make it secure by compiling your own kernel in binary levels.

\item \textbf{What are your strengths and weaknesses? (Use these to develop your personal development goals.)}
\hfill\break
\hfill\break
My strengths are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item My strong leadership. 
    \item I'm adaptive. I can fill every role when it needs to.
    \item I'm very social. Maybe too social. People can find comfort in my positive attitude and appearance and I don't judge people on their first mistakes.
\end{enumerate}

My weaknesses are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item My stubbornness
    \item I'm too social. Since I like to talk some students and teachers are getting headaches from my loud voice which is understandable plus this can distract me and by the end of the day, I have not done any work.
\hfill\break
\hfill\break
    \item My documentation. The previous semester I had issues making structured documentation which made it barely readable since it was all over the place. (I used Google Docs back then and now I've switched to Overleaf: LaTeX) 
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Learning Outcomes}
\subsection{Ethical Hacker and Risk Consultant (Red/Attacking)}
\begin{itemize}
\item How did you obtain Body of Knowledge* about the involved subjects? (note: just a summary needed here; what were your favorite subjects, overall impression? You can refer to the BoK-document section)
\item How did you apply your skills in the project?
\item What have you learned considering this Learning Outcome?
\item \textbf{What are you proud of?}
\hfill\break
\hfill\break
That I went full Footprinting mode into our first meeting. I've mapped their whole IT with all possible ports, laptops, Computers, and operating systems just by looking around and talking/ asking sneaky questions to them. Even the teachers were impressed with how much info I got and noted into my notes and drew a small map into my iPad Pro.
\item Which aspects do you want to develop further?
\item What will you do differently next time?
\item What grade would you give yourself on the corresponding Learning Outcome?
\end{itemize}

\section{Personal Projects}
\begin{itemize}
\item How did you spend your hours for:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Personal Vulnerability Investigation (expected about 5x4h = 20 hours)}
\hfill\break
\hfill\break
First I needed to propose the subject. Hacking SMBv1 with Fritzbox and made a small proposal before starting to take materials from home and starting the research.
\item \textbf{Internship Preparation (expected about 10 hours)}
\hfill\break
\hfill\break
Apparently, I skipped this by accident because they sent a mail like an etiquette and i thought it was a spam so I ignored it. But I'm happy to announce that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Updated my \textbf{\href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/kostapoum/}{LinkedIn (link)}}
    \item Have an \textbf{\href{https://poumpouridis.carrd.co}{ e-business card (link)}}
    \item Went to carrier day in Fontys Strijp S
\end{enumerate}
\item Personal Specialisation Project (expected about 10x4h = 40 hours)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
